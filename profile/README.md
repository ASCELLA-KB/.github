# Ascella KB

Knowledge base and data portal for the multi-tissue project, hosting comprehensive multi-tissue genomic and proteomic data analysis.

## Overview

Ascella KB serves as the central data repository and analysis platform for multi-tissue research, focusing on:

- **Heart** - Cardiac function, cardiomyocyte and vascular cell analysis
- **Liver** - Metabolic processing and hepatocyte profiling
- **Lung** - Respiratory function, alveolar and bronchial cell characterization
- **Pancreas** - Endocrine and exocrine function, islet cell analysis

The platform provides tools for exploring genomic data, protein pathways and cell type mapping across human tissues for neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory disease research.

## Features

- **Multi-Tissue Data Portal** - Explore genomic and proteomic data across human tissues
- **Cross-Tissue Analysis** - Comparative genomics and systems biology tools
- **Expression Atlas** - Gene expression patterns across tissues with cell-specific estimators
- **Pathway Networks** - Metabolic and signaling pathway analysis
- **Cell Type Mapping** - Identify cell types across tissues based on molecular signatures
